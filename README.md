## FILES REQUIRED TO BUILD BONZIFY
These files are not made by me and could be copyrighted, so you have to get them on your own (altough most likely no one would care).
Most of them are contained in BonziBuddy432.exe, which is commonly [available](https://archive.org/download/BonziBuddy432.7z/BonziBuddy432.7z) on the internet.
